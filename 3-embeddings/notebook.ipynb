What advice can you give me ? God: What advice can I give humanity? Atom: I suppose so God: Live your life. Don’t waste your days on the negative energy of others. Remember that you’re not your salary. You’re not your house. You’re not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone else’s. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not bout the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. So live your life to the fullest, according to your happiness and the betterment of all Kai: Damn man, we’ve been walking forever Thomas: Well, Thalias tracking system says we’ll be there in just over an hour Kai: Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?

Do you love me yet? No? Okay I'll go harder for you In fact, I rap till I collapse All I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own Come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed About the ways to raise a child up To not become a product Of his environment, I need to cry and vent But I done built this wall up Actin' like everything's all good But in reality I'm lookin' for something Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after Nas, Cole, and Hov Eyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn' I'm used to being alone Shit, you know how long I've been out on my own? Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant Boosting my ego with every million that spills in And still then I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?

And I’m gonna tell you about how All this young boy ever wanted was happiness All he ever wanted was positivity All he ever wanted to do was entertain And this boy went through hell You gotta understand, his mother was racist, which is crazy 'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have All these black babies with black men but you racist Like bitch, that don’t make no sense, but it is what it is You know, he grew up, her callin' him a nigger The kids at school callin' him a cracker Identifying as black, looking as white Being told what you can or can’t be This kid went through everything He went through... He saw narcotics in the household Violence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped There was crazy shit that happened to this kid And he persevered while the whole world said What they said? Said you wouldn’t be shit! You ain’t gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing And I, and he, he said fuck that, I’ma persevere And that’s why the message is always peace, love and positivity See, he always saw things from two sides He always saw things from two sides He always knew that the message Everybody was born equal Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation He knew that because he saw that (Take it back, take it way back Take it way) Because he was stripped and torn down By his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated And that did not know And he was stripped and he was torn down By his white side that did not know These people that are ignorant That cannot see the bigger picture That must fight and kill and murder each other But once again, all he ever wanted to do Was spread a message of equality For every man, woman, and child Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation (Take it back, take it way back Take it way, way back to the first) Now imagine this child growing up And seeing the craziest shit Being a part of the craziest shit Running around with the wrong people Running around with guns and knives And fighting and stealing and, and all this Because he didn’t know, he didn’t know! But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn’t right And he knew that he needed to get away from it Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings And then he would then come home To about eight or nine hours of sleep But spend four, five, six hours of that Working on music, persevering Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people Just chanting his name Hoping that it would happen But the, but the, but the world said no! Mothafucka, little mothafucka no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka No-no! (Take it back, take it way back Take it way, way back to the first) And he said fuck that He said peace, love, and positivity He said equality for all man Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation, yeah Now I want you to also imagine People telling him that he did not live this life “You just a white boy You ain’t never experienced that shit You from Gaithersburg, Maryland, nothing happens there Oh no, no, we know, we weren’t there We didn’t live with you, we didn't live in your Section 8 household We didn’t live with the narcotics and violence in your household We just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside Outside, outside, outside, outside And since you white, you gotta have money, right?” (Take it back, take it way back Take it way, way back to the first black man) And this young man persevered in spite Of what people told him he was, wasn’t, and would never be (Take it back, take it way back Take it way, way back to the first black) And that man is here today, proud A lover of all human beings Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation, yeah, yeah And he’s here to say: Even though we’re all born and created equal We are not treated equally There’s extremists on every side And you should just do your best to live life And let other people believe whatever they wanna believe As long as they’re not hurtin' anybody You can believe they’re going to hell You can believe it’s not right You can believe you’re superior, fine Just stop killing each other I wonder what it feel like To do that shit in real life And now I know I got it That's the reason No I.D. has signed me on the dotted But it's still Visionary till the death of me Yeah, I'm trynna make it but I gotta find the recipe Greatest of all time, I want the world addressing me At the hotel, these beautiful girls undressing me I'm trynna stay focused, I guess that's the lord testing me I knew as a child, that this was my destiny They do it for the limelight But I make sure my rhyme's right Waiting till the time's right Smiling at my mom's like Smiling at my mom Smiling at my momma Moët what we sipping now We was never tripping now We on private jets, in other words, that means that we tripping now Cause they was over there, I was over here They was too scared while I was facing my fears I've always been driven, but they too scared to steer That's why I compete with legends, motherfuck my peers  I'm the man of the year, man of the year Man of the year, man of the year Man of the year, man of the year  They said I couldn't do it Back when I was broke going through it Till I got a deal, now they talking 'bout \"I knew it\" But you wasn't there in the beginning Nowhere to be found when I was down But you show up when I'm winning Uh, left me to drown, now I'm swimming I do it cause I love this shit Fuck the money, and the women, and the- And the whips with the rims still spinning I been at it since the beginning All these girls screaming \"Logic\" But I wanna hear my real name Come from the lips of a beautiful woman, that's real man Y'all act like I'm Superman But I can feel pain I shoulda gone crazy, and yet I'm still sane Love it when they sing to us Been shining what's bling to us Yeah, over here It's only been a year I was dirt broke, now I'm balling like a sphere  I'm the man of the year, man of the year Man of the year, man of the year Man of the year, man of the year  Now that I'm in the limelight They hit me all the time like (Logic, you never call me!)

How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance? How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death? Derealization The sense of being out of one’s body I’m not here I’m not me I’m not real Nothing is Nothing but this feeling of panic Nobody understands Nobody knows the sufferings This physical feeling It can’t be anxiety It can’t Or can it? Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body? Yeah, of course I’m so in control of my mind and my body But I’m subconsciously forcing myself into a state Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind I am unhappy Not with life But with this feeling I am scared, I am human, I am a man But I look in the mirror and I see a child I am an adult who recognize grown ups don’t really know shit And they never did And it scares me Cause now I’m just a grown up who doesn’t know shit But one thing is I do know this feeling, this horrible feeling is going to kill me No, no this feeling This anxiety is nothing I have anxiety Just like you, the person I wrote this for And together we will overcome this feeling We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge That we are alive And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted We will rejoice in this gift that is life We will rejoice in this day that we have been given We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves Starting with mental health We will accept ourselves as we are And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror We will accept ourselves And live with anxiety I know that you think this song is for you I used to long for you and adore you My life was just fine way back before you Now when you reach out I just ignore you  Cause this ain't a love song (woah) This is, \"So long\" You did me so wrong for so long For so long, for so long  No, I never thought I could live my life without you All you ever seem to do is scream and make it all about you  And so I doubt you I doubt you even know what's on my mind I said, I doubt you I doubt you even know why I left you behind  I know that I've been living I know that I've been living I know that I've been living I know that I've been living In the city of stars, where there's flying cars A brand new home for everyone and even life on Mars In the city of stars, where there's flying cars A brand new home for everyone and even life on Mars  This ain't a love song (woah) This is, \"So long\" You did me so wrong for so long For so long, for so long  And so I doubt you I doubt you even know what's on my mind I said I doubt you I doubt you even know why I left you—  Yeah, uh, yeah...

Living life on the East Coast Way back in the day trying to beat most Anybody that wanna do what I do Well let me keep it one hunnit with you It ain’t about that; ain’t about Hip Hop, ain’t about Rap Take a minute, hold up, wait, now use your cap Chicago, know I’mma snap Nah, this ain't no basic rap  And so they wonder who am I—so high (so high) I said they wonder who am I—so high  Back again, never outside so I’m acting in I laugh again when they don’t understand What I mean, bias; everybody seen by us Everybody wanna live a life like this Man fuck that, do what’s good for your family Make music like there’s no Grammy For that last line they might ban me I don’t give a fuck though 'Cause I am me, from Beijing to Miami I’mma just do what I do with my crew Ain’t no telling what I’m finna do But I promise that I’mma keep writing for you And I know what to do, everything right here for you Only for you, depending on what you gon' do It’s all for you—it’s all for you  Who am I—so high (so high) I said they wonder who am I—so high  Let me take this time to find the rhyme And know that I’m the only one To find the one, the time is done Beyond the sky, beyond the sun There is no one besides the only one And you know I gotta let ‘em know If you love it, let it go At an all time low and all I know is, all I know I do what I love, came from below and then rose up above Created a world no one has been to Everything that I’m into, everything that I’ve been through Bring it back like, let it shine like a Bat Light Reminiscing on that night, gotta take flight Everybody probably wonder what I’m living like In the middle of the night I might write Despite what they say is right and wrong Despite they wonder (wonder)  Who am I—so high (so high) I said they wonder who am I—so high  We’d like to be painters, we’d like to be poets. We’d like to be writers, but as everybody knows—we can’t earn any money that way. What do you want to do? When we finally got down to something which the individual says he really wants to do, I will say to him you do that—and uhm—forget the money. If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time... You’ll be doing things you don’t like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things you don’t like doing, which is stupid! It is absolutely stupid! Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way. And after all, if you do really like what you’re doing, it doesn’t matter what it is—somebody is interested in everything—anything you can be interested in, you will find others who are... But, it’s absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don’t like and to teach our children to follow in the same track. See, what we are doing is, we’re bringing up children and educating them to live the same sort of lives we are living—in order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life, by bringing up their children, to bring up \"their\" children, to do the same thing. So, it’s all retch and no vomit—it never gets there. Therefore, it’s so important to consider this question... \"What do I desire?\"  The Incredible True Story And Transformation of the Man Who Saved the World  Surface contact in 400 meters... 300 meters... 200 meters...

I would definitely have to probably have to say Kill Bill  114 feet—  Man, stylistically he’s like—what’s the name of that bitch? The lead character? I forgot her name, but he’s like that bitch—with like some Kung-Fu shit he’s like with his raps. It’s fucking crazy!  You know in—in Pulp Fiction I mean—the way Tarantino constructed his shots, it’s the same feel for me with his raps you know? There’s thought behind it...

Aight, well—higher probably, right? Fuck it, just record it. Who cares? One, two...  I just wanna make these music lovers remember again While the haters fall back like September again I was hoping 3 Stacks and Big would assemble again Drop the politics and bring us together again Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then, yeah, yeah But I'm not defined by the sales of my first week 'Cause in my mind, the only way I fail: if my verse weak As I look in the crowd and see thousands of different faces Compiled of different races, gathering from different places I just contemplate, shout out to those who can relate And even though it gets hard I know my fate With my train of thought racing like a runaway freight Living life to the fullest until I hit up them gates, it's like  I'ma get up today I don’t know how but I'ma find a way Looking for the sun in a world of gray Feeling like my dream is a world away I'ma get up today I don’t know how but I'ma find a way Searching for the sun in a world of grey Feeling like my dream is a world away What it feel like? I used to wonder what it feel like Yeah, used to wonder what it  I used to wonder what it feel like But now, I know, achieved the goal I ran the race, I won the gold I used to wonder what it feel like But now, I know, achieved the goal I ran the race, I won the gold I used to wonder what it feel like But now, I know, achieved the goal I ran the race, I won the gold I used to wonder what it feel like But now, I know, achieved the goal I ran the race, I won the gold I used to wonder what it feel like  You can really do anything You can really do anything You can really do anything You can really do anything  Hello. Welcome to the 'Under Pressure' program My name is Thalia. I will be here to assist you with the information about the album and its creation Logic  I got a date with destiny My heart says yeah but can’t convince the rest of me I tried so hard to make it with no recipe My selfish ways caught up and got the best of me I need redemption no need to mention my past Cause all that matters now is bigger than diamonds and cash The glitz, the glamor, the lights, the camera, the action The stage, the fans, the speakers blasting You know I want it, I need it Don’t doubt it, I can’t live without it This is everything I dreamed of It’s everything I’ve ever wanted But is it really truly in my plans Or did God mix up my blueprints? Did he have it right there in his hands? Anybody give me a hint I can feel it now I know it’s coming And I don’t give a fuck what anybody say I’ve fallen, I’ve risen, I chose and selected this mission Incarceration through these bars created a prison And I intend to do the time that the sentence is given 25 to life yeah that’s how I’m living Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever make it But there’s only way I'ma know I’m like a seed planted in the dirt Feels like I’ve been waiting forever to grow And maybe today is the day And maybe tonight is the night But one thing that I know for sure This time I’ma get it right  Logic, Logic, Logic, Logic I want what I want how I want when I want it I’ma keep it a hunnid, I’m blunted I don’t give a damn, I don’t give a fuck about another man Fuck a brother man I’ma make it, make it rain like the weather man Old girl shoulda, shoulda got a better man Ass fat, lookin' good in my letterman In the hood I’m a better man Wish a mothafucka would, would Whole life I been up to no good Change it all if I could Rearrange my heart, the beat good but I can’t I’m a sinner, not a saint Layers to my life, no I can’t Cover it up with paint Keep on livin', livin' Livin' on money and women As soon as I’m in 'em, I’m out Now the truth never come out my mouth Speak life when I come in her mouth, like  I’m a dirty mothafucka, a waste of life, a waste of skin Wanna repent, don’t know where to begin Next of kin don’t give a damn 'bout me I know God don’t give a damn 'bout me People try but don’t know 'bout me But the Devil said that he want my soul But the Devil said that he want my soul Give it to me right now Give it to me right now Give it to me right now Give it to me right now  Somebody save me I need you to save me To wash away my sins on high  I’d rather be a different man in another world Than work for the man in my universe Wonder what it feel like to take flight Momma told me everything gon' be alright I mean my life can’t be off right But come to think about it Everybody runnin' the world seem to be all white Can you mothafuckas see alright? I mean, I need it, I want it, I gotta have it Every day tragic If you’re from where I’m from, everyday ain’t magic On this I know I been telling everybody I’ma give it a go, I know I been there before, feel it in my soul, oh I know! Love it or hate it, I made it I did it, I lived it While the whole world lookin' at the boy like whoa! Baptized in a ocean of Hennessey Really wonder what the remedy Tell me, how the world gon' remember me? Got me feelin like the enemy Like I ain’t got no energy I been lookin' for an entity Feelin' like I need to chill, like I need a new amenity Fuck all that  I’m a dirty mothafucka, a waste of life A waste of skin Wanna repent, don’t know where to begin Next of kin don’t give a damn 'bout me I know God don’t give a damn 'bout me People try but don’t know 'bout me But the Devil said that he want my soul But the Devil said that he want my soul Give it to me right now Give it to me right now Give it to me right now Give it to me right now  Somebody save me I need you to save me To wash away my sins on high  I know my life was lived the wrong way I know I did you wrong in my own way But it was the flashing lights that mesmerized That hypnotized the only Part of me you loved Part of me that had the strength to rise above Part of me you know Part of me you love more than to let it go  Dear God, I just wanna know why Why do you put us here? Why do you put us below? Why do you put us subservient? Why do you put us below these evil motherfuckers? And then we crawl and we scratch our way out We betray each other We lie, we take from one another And we told you gon' forgive us at the end But the state don't forgive us I'm locked up and half my friends And then when I get out, or I make it out I'm expected to somehow give back To people who never wanted to see me escape I'm startin' to hate the man in the mirror And it's gettin' clearer That society was designed to keep me on the bottom So, if you real, if you're out there for real Please explain to me why Why do we suffer? Why do we die? And why do the people Who go against everything you ever said always get ahead? I've done so much wrong, I don't know if I can ever be right But tonight, I am in this church Asking you to show yourself, to reveal yourself to me Because I'm tired and I don't know what else to do So black I'm blue, so brown I'm down I done been everywhere but up, and when I finally get up I am ravaged with guilt and pain and shame And all I wanna do is believe in you The darker you are, the closer you are to dirt And they make sure it hurts And I am tired of hurtin', man I'm tired of bein' looked at, second guessed, doubted, feared So if you out there, do something about this 'Cause I can't take it no more Help me\n"
